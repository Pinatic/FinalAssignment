State the region and the domain category that your data sets are about

	Data is collected at location Nes, Ameland. The data is from water hight and water temperature.

State the research question

	The research question states: How does the independent variable water temperature influence the dependent variable of water hight?

	H0: There is no effect on water hight caused by the water temperature 
	H1: There is a effect on water hight caused by the water temperature

Justify the chosen data storage and processing approach

	The data is stored in their original file and are kept original, this way all procceses that are done are shown.
	The proccessing of the data is done by multiple functions. 
	The data is first cleaned, then translated, then unused data is dropped.
	After this the used data is optimized for furter proccessing. (optimized by combining some columns and renaming, converting to other dtypes)

Justify the chosen analysis approach

	For analysis, the water hight is devided in 3 equal sized groups, grouped by temperature range/number of datapoints.

Justify the chosen data visualization approach

	For the visualization, the data is first shown sepperate.
	Then a scatter plot is shown with a regression line.
	After the regrouping, a one way anova is done on the grouped data. This gives a pvalue to indicate if there is a significant effect.
